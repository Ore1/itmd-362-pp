## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52v130k7s8B5Ng038a33W8h4C62
Your Rationale: From the reserach I did about game consoles, most of them are black and have different colors of lights when turned on. So I chose darker versions of these colors (green, blue, and yellow).

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32C0m1kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkpespaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: Garden is associated with lots of green! Spring is also associated with green because plants/trees are coming back to life. I chose bright colors such as green to symbolize grass, and trees. Purple and dark orange to symbolize flowers. The colors will also attract people's attantion to the flyer. 

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3281o1kgv2pLGu3pXoqxFn3iMnCkGxBq0i+Esm++Sm++D1++knY9l3dPmHLJSYStTAOqE
Your Rationale: I wanted the login page to have a fun and exciting interaction. I chose black as a base color, then brown/blue as the color around the input field, lemon as text. All 3 colors or two could be used to create the logo for the app.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1080u0ks2kgkdoIn5s+qkg3-WeP
Your Rationale: Based on the research I did about Ruby on Rails, I noticed that the colors being constantly used were shades of orange and brown. So I decided to go with tones and shades of brown and orange.
