# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/text-fields/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: In the username input field, there's a hint for the user to follow. A placeholder shows the pattern or example of what to write in the username text field. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The login page is mobile responsive. It is responsive in portrait and landscape orientations for mobile, ipad, tablets, and laptops. The text size changes according to the orientation and device size.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-views/alerts/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Since there is a password input, an alert message is important. The alert message pops up when a user inputs an inccorect password or username. The message displayed is short and easy to understand.
