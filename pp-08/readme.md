# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

The object I chose is my backpack

* Visceral: The bag is physically attractive because it has many pretty colors (blue, pruple, green & black). 

* Behavioral: I like the bag because it has many compartments of various sizes. It is very useful for me depending on the kinds of things I fit into it. It fits my laptop, umbrella and other personal and school effects I need.

* Reflective: It is durable because I have been using it for about 3 years now. It doesn't get dirty easily because of the colors and people always ask this question: "Is it new?"

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Attractiveness is very important in design because it is what attracts a user to a particular website most times.
2. Project 2 MyIIT redesign needs to be simple to use and easy to navigate for the user's experience.  
3. It needs to satisfy the user's needs (example: registering for classes, view schedule etc.)
