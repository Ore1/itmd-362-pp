# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://www.studyweb.com/test-your-website-a-57-point-checklist-for-maximum-usability/
2. https://stayintech.com/info/UX

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Navigation bar should be clear and could be color coded when user clicks on it.
2. There should be enough white space on the page so the user doesn't feel overwhelmed with too much things squashed together.
3. Fields in forms should be labeled with common terms and have placeholders show a hint of what to type to the user.
4. Images should represent whatever message is being passed across to the user.
5. Implement alert messages that are short and well descriptive to the user when something goes wrong.
6. Make sure the text and background have adequate contrast.
7. Be concise in the content so you don't bore the reader.
8. Make sure text is bold enough to be seen according to different viewports. 
9. The site needs to be responsive with different screen sizes in both portrait and landscape orientations.
10. Make sure there's no spelling errors! Cross all "t"s and dot all "i"s.
